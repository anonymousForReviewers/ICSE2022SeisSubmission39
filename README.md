This is the website for artifact evaluation of ICSE2022-SEIS sumbission 39: Path Toward Elderly-User-Friendly Mobile Apps: Empirical Studies and Guidelines of App Adaptation for Elderly Users





**LiteratureReview** contains our code for crawling papers and results, which are used by our LITERATURE REVIEW (section 2).

1. ​		**ACMsave** contains papers collected from ACM digital library. **IEEEsave** contains papers collected from IEEEXplore. For paper published both by ACM and IEEE, they appear in ACMsave.	
2. ​		**analysis.xlsx**	contains results of analyzing the final pool of papers.\





**MaterialAnalysis** contains our collected news reports, which are used by our ANALYSIS OF MATERIALS OVER THE INTERNET (section 3)

1. ​	**AppMarketInfo** contains the user comments  along with the code for analyzing the comments.
2. ​	**Media** contains the news reports.



**EmpInvestigation** contains the version update logs and app UI screenshots we record during our inspection. We anoynomize them by masking identity-revealing information. These materials are used in EMPIRICAL INVESTIGATION BASED ON INSPECTION OF APP ADAPTATION (section 4).

1. ​		For version update logs, we use keywords '老年', '老人', '大字', '亲情' (represent elderly in Chinese) to find out whether the app has undergone adaptation.
2. ​		In **AppScreenshot**, each folder in it represents an inspection of a app (specified by the folder name). before_i and after_i represent the adapted app's UI screen and the original app's UI screen in the same scenario i.
