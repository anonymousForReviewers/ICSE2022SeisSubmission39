"Evaluating Software Project Managers: A Multidimensional Perspective","L. Peters; A. M. Moreno",Universidad Politécnica de Madrid; Universidad Politécnica de Madrid,"IEEE Software","13 Nov 2017","2017","34","6","104","108","Qualified, motivated project managers are key contributors to software organizations. Experts have identified a capable project manager as the most important factor in a software project's success. Project managers' value to software projects, software engineers, and their companies is unquestionable. Thus, getting the most out of those managers is critical. The literature about knowledge workers' psychological profiles show that the best motivator is feedback about how well they've done. This is consistent with our experience in software project management and consulting. Frequent, detailed feedback can also be a positive learning experience and an opportunity to improve skills. Feedback and recognition require the evaluation of professionals, who must accept responsibility for their work if they're going to consider assessments as an opportunity instead of a burden. However, the criteria needed to evaluate professionals aren't obvious. Unfortunately, the literature provides little empirical data about evaluating software project managers. At best, the literature refers to assessing managers in terms of whether a project meets or exceeds its time and cost requirements. Our combined 50 years' experience in software project management (see the “Our Experience in Software Project Management” sidebar) has revealed some best practices for evaluating software project managers.","1937-4194","","10.1109/MS.2017.4121223","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8106867","software project managers;evaluations;multidimensional;senior managers;software engineers;clients;balanced scorecard;software engineering;software development;Voice of Evidence","Software engineering;Project management;Stakeholders;Appraisal","DP industry;human factors;project management;software development management","software project manager evaluation;software organizations;software engineers;software project management;software project consulting;best practices;knowledge workers psychological profiles","","2","","12","","13 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

These laws focused on the physical well-being of robots and humans. But they can also be applied to software in a more abstract manner, by focusing on human presence in cyberspace. In this vein, I suggest the following laws of software. While they are largely a restatement of known principles, uniting them in this way casts a new light on the contract between humanity and technology.","1937-4194","","10.1109/MS.2007.100","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4267613","Asimov's Laws of Robotics;software requirements","Robots;Protection;Security;Computer crashes;Senior citizens;Application software;User interfaces;Software systems;Turning;Authorization","security of data;software engineering","robotics;software laws;Isaac Asimov formulated;human presence;cyberspace;humanity;technology;data protection","","","","","","9 Jul 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

After it was pulled away, the Wizard was a kind, sympathetic, elderly statesman who used his wisdom and position to recognize and reward the contributions of individual team members, honor their collective accomplishments and join with the team leader in a partnership to accomplish the team's goal. The Wizard's role was to identify problems and collective solutions, find out what was important to the project and the individuals, affirm and recognize the qualities necessary for success, inspire the team to even greater strength and accomplishment, and solidify their commitment to their vision and goals. The elements and people essential to project success have changed over the last few years. Not every project is perfect, with clearly defined requirements and goals.

They are also learning that the more integral software measurement is to the company's underlying business strategy, the more likely it is to succeed. We propose a framework or metamodel called the Model, Measure, Manage Paradigm (M/sup 3/P), which is our extension of the well known Quality Improvement Paradigm/Goal-Question-Metric paradigm (R.B. Grady, 1992; V.R. Basili and H.D. Rombach, 1988). M/sup 3/P helps counter a contributing factor commonly seen in failed measurement programs, namely the lack of well defined links between the numerical data and the surrounding development and business contexts, by coupling technical, business, and organizational issues into a given measurement program context. An example where links are important is in highly technical measurement and analysis reports which do not generally answer the concerns of senior executives. We present some early experience with our framework gathered from several case studies, discuss the 8 stages of M/sup 3/P implementation and describe a tool set we developed for use with M/sup 3/P.","1937-4194","","10.1109/52.582974","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=582974","","Software measurement;Software safety;Reliability engineering;Companies;Project management;Software development management;Software quality;Software testing;Production;Engineering management","software metrics;software quality;business data processing;professional aspects","software measurement programs;underlying business strategy;metamodel;Model Measure Manage Paradigm;Quality Improvement Paradigm/Goal-Question-Metric paradigm;failed measurement programs;well defined links;numerical data;business contexts;organizational issues;measurement program context;highly technical measurement;senior executives;case studies;M/sup 3/P implementation","","56","2","16","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Like other medium to large companies, SMS had reached a scale and maturity level that required the development process to be documented, predictable, repeatable, measurable, and usable by the development groups. After much study and consideration, senior management committed to implementing a universal OO development methodology. Senior management recognized the need to improve customer satisfaction, which had always been high but needed to he better in an increasingly competitive market. Management saw the introduction of usability practices as a prime means to achieve this objective. So they began to place greater emphasis on usability-even to the point of building and staffing dual state-of-the-art usability labs. Our goal throughout the projects we describe was to combine the best OO analysis and design practices and usability techniques to create a powerful, unified way to develop software.","1937-4194","","10.1109/52.903166","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=903166","","Usability;Programming;User centered design;Software engineering;Process design;Terminology;Collaborative software;Medical services;Computer industry;Software measurement","software engineering;user centred design;user interfaces;object-oriented methods;management of change","usability techniques;software development;Siemens Medical Solutions Health Services;Shared Medical Systems;health care industry;clinical software;financial software;administrative software;OO development methodology;customer satisfaction;usability practices","","31","","15","","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

At the telecom company Ericsson, change agents were frustrated that requests to participate in improvement projects often precipitated behavior from colleagues that hampered progress.

In this article, we show how to analyze slowdown behavior, increase commitment and reinforce progress.","1937-4194","","10.1109/MS.2008.151","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4670719","process improvement;progress;commitment;effort","Project management;Engineering management;Delay;Telecommunications;Psychology;Signal analysis;Productivity;Testing;Continuous improvement;Design engineering","management of change;project management;software development management;software maintenance;software process improvement","software process improvement;software project management;software change management","","5","","10","","11 Nov 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

These defenses increasingly are critical to an organization's information security posture and should be implemented in an effective, systematic, and repeatable fashion. Senior-level managers or executives should review process measurement data regularly to ensure that these defenses are being performed properly and to provide an objective basis for organizational improvement. This article focuses on lessons learned implementing improvements in the first of these defenses, security patch management, and is derived largely from pilot projects conducted in collaboration with Consortium members. The need for improved security patch management figured prominently in the recent draft cyber security strategy issued by the White House. The practices examined in this article can assist organizations in substantially reducing the risk from Internet-based compromises.","1937-4194","","10.1109/MS.2003.1159029","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1159029","","Internet;Information security;Software tools;Data security;Computer security;Productivity;Software measurement;IP networks;Application software;Reconnaissance","authorisation;Internet","Internet based intrusions;security patch management;Internet-based threats;application hardening;network reconnaissance;malicious software","","20","5","18","","6 Jan 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"
