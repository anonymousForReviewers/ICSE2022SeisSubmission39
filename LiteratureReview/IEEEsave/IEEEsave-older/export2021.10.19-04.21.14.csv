"An approach to measure software maintenance and support as a value added component of today's business","H. Raj Sood; D.

Proceedings.","22 Nov 2004","2004","","","503","","There has been considerable investment by Dofasco in existing manufacturing process software. Also, it has been shown that software must evolve to continue to be useful, and thus enhancement/perfective maintenance work is a common activity in an industrial environment. Since software maintenance can consume as much as 70 % of the lifecycle costs of a software system, there is constant pressure from our internal clients to reduce maintenance costs. This proposal describes an approach of reclassifying maintenance activities to provide a measurement tool for clients and senior management, to see a true picture of efforts spent on ""business support"", ""retain benefits"" and to obtain ""business benefits"".","1063-6773","0-7695-2213-0","10.1109/ICSM.2004.1357851","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1357851","","Software measurement;Software maintenance;Manufacturing automation;Costs;Manufacturing processes;Productivity;Resource management;Steel;Continuous improvement;Investments","manufacturing data processing;software metrics;software maintenance","software maintenance;manufacturing process software;industrial environment;software system;business support;business benefits","","","","","","22 Nov 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
