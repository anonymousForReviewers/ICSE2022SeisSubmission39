My current work mainly considers the analyses of package structure and its relation to the grouping of test cases. With this I aim to help senior developers to find problematic or hard to understand parts of software. During my research I introduced an elaborated test coverage based method to find and classify discrepancies between dynamic and static production and test code grouping. This technique helps both testers and developers to find stray test cases or code elements in Java package structure. In the second to last section I briefly introduce my other two research topics and their possible applications in the field of software testing.","","978-1-5386-5012-7","10.1109/ICST.2018.00053","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8367073","test analyses;test coverage;testing;productivity;visualization;static analyses;dynamic analyses;process metric","Software;Measurement;Conferences;Productivity;Urban areas;Software testing;Tools","human factors;program testing","software systems;software development;human factor;senior developers;static production;test code grouping;stray test cases;code elements;Java package structure;software testing;software testers;test coverage;software engineers;dynamic production","","","","6","","28 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"A System Analysis Study Comparing Reverse Engineered Combinatorial Testing to Expert Judgment","A. M. Cunningham Jr.; J. Hagar; R. J. Holman",NA; NA; NA,"2012 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Software Testing, Verification and Validation","17 May 2012","2012","","","630","635","The Lockheed Martin F-16 ventral fin redesign-combinatorial test study effort was to demonstrate how Combinatorial Testing (CT) could have been applied to system hardware design flaw analysis. The historic analysis was able to determine a set of combinations, which isolated the problem and tested a solution. However, the original effort was expensive, time consuming, and required highly specialized knowledge from the expert to be effective. The new study was an effort to understand if combinatorial test could be applied to similar situations using the original data but conducted by a less senior person without an expert's knowledgebase. The situation and CT approaches are detailed in this paper. In the study, a series of iterations created combinatorial test cases which could have ""replicated"" the original highly optimized and successful test program, without the expert.","2159-4848","978-0-7695-4670-4","10.1109/ICST.2012.151","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6200163","Case-Study;Combinatorial Test;Design problem","Testing;Aircraft;Aerodynamics;Industries;NIST;Analytical models;Fatigue","aerospace components;aerospace computing;failure analysis;program testing;reverse engineering","reverse engineered combinatorial testing;expert judgment;system analysis study;Lockheed Martin F-16 ventral fin redesign combinatorial test study;system hardware design flaw analysis;CT approaches;test program","","4","","7","","17 May 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
