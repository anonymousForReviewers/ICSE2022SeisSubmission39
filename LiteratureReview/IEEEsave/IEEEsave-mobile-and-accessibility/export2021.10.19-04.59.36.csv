Following the law of the US, EU, mobile OS vendors such as Google and Apple have included accessibility features in their mobile systems and provide a set of guidelines and toolsets for ensuring mobile app accessibility. Motivated by this trend, researchers have conducted empirical studies by using the inaccessibility issue rate of each page (i.e., screen level) to represent the characteristics of mobile app accessibility. However, there still lacks an empirical investigation directly focusing on the issues themselves (i.e., issue level) to unveil more fine-grained findings, due to the lack of an effective issue detection method and a relatively comprehensive dataset of issues. To fill in this literature gap, we first propose an automated app page exploration tool, named Xbot, to facilitate app accessibility testing and automatically collect accessibility issues by leveraging the instrumentation technique and static program analysis. Owing to the relatively high activity coverage (around 80%) achieved by Xbot when exploring apps, Xbot achieves better performance on accessibility issue collection than existing testing tools such as Google Monkey. With Xbot, we are able to collect a relatively comprehensive accessibility issue dataset and finally collect 86,767 issues from 2,270 unique apps including both closed-source and open-source apps, based on which we further carry out an empirical study from the perspective of accessibility issues themselves to investigate novel characteristics of accessibility issues. Specifically, we extensively investigate these issues by checking 1) the overall severity of issues with multiple criteria, 2) the in-depth relation between issue types and app categories, GUI component types, 3) the frequent issue patterns quantitatively, and 4) the fixing status of accessibility issues. Finally, we highlight some insights to the community and hope to raise the attention to maintaining mobile app accessibility for users especially the elderly and disabled.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2021.3108162","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62102197,62102284); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9525343","Mobile Accessibility;Empirical Study;Automated Accessibility Testing;Android App;Xbot","Testing;Mobile applications;Tools;Internet;Guidelines;Fans;Statistics","","","","","","","IEEE","30 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"
"Dynamic adaptation and deployment of distributed components in Hadas","I. Ben-Shaul; O. Holder; B. Lavva","Dept. of Electr.

By encapsulating and representing such services as components, they can be effectively composed into sophisticated wide-area applications that otherwise would be much harder to build. This paper presents a component model for encapsulating such services and a composition model for assembling encapsulated and possibly active services into new applications, while preserving the administrative autonomy of sites and individual components. The component model is dynamically and self-adaptable, allowing for the adjustment of structure and behavior of autonomous components to changing or previously unknown contexts in which they need to operate. The composition model includes a set of protocols that enable us to dynamically deploy live components into remote sites and to dynamically reconfigure the deployment scheme through reflective stubs termed Ambassadors. The component and composition models have been fully implemented in Hadas, which also includes a host of tools for the creation, deployment, and composition of autonomous components.","1939-3520","","10.1109/32.950315","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=950315","","Distributed computing;Application software;Intelligent networks;Assembly;Context modeling;Protocols;Systems engineering and theory;Java;Reflection;Large-scale systems","distributed object management;data encapsulation","dynamic adaptation;dynamic deployment;distributed components;Hadas;global network connectivity;geographically dispersed services;wide-area applications;encapsulation;administrative autonomy;component model;composition model;Ambassadors;autonomous components;self adaptive components;distributed systems;Java;negotiation;reflection;mobile objects","","25","","44","","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
